Rice Bootcamp Challenge Assignment 19: Text Editor PWA

## Introduction

Task: To build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a 
single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will 
feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancies in 
case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will 
also function offline.

## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client-server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the back end and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB database
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using Workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets precached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Heroku
